    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>
      This is a ruby on rails implementation of Twitter coded by Mohamed Ahmad in May 2012.  The design is taken from a tutorial called <a href="http://railstutorial.org/">Ruby on Rails Tutorial</a>. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mohamed's intention here is to show his ability to do software development using Ruby on Rails, MySQL, and Node.js.  Also, the testing methodology used is Rspec, which shows Mohamed's ability to do the Red, Green, Refactor test cycle.
    </p>

    <p>
      The development environment was set up by Mohamed on his Windows 7 64bit machine.  He installed Ruby, Rails, GitBash, created a github account, installed MySQL 5, MySQL COnnector C, Node.js javascript runtime environment, and Rspec.
